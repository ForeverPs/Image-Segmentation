# Image-Segmentation
Medical Images Segmentation based on U-net
***
I have to remind you that you should create folder like below:
***
## test->image->picture in type .nii
## train->groundtruth->the corresponding results of training samples in type .nii
## train->image->training samples in type .nii
### if your samples is not in type of .nii, you should change some parts of the code based on the errors or warnings
### U-net is fairly a liittle complicated which means that you have to use a quite qualified GPU to train the samples.
### we train the network with the help of a work station provided by our college, so many thanks to our college
